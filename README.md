# Blockchain in Python

---

This project is an implementation of a blockchain in Python, 
which includes core features such as block creation, transaction processing, and a consensus algorithm. 
It consists of two modules: one implements the blockchain using Flask to create an API, 
while the other represents a simpler implementation of the blockchain using classes.

> Warning! This is a fairly old version that I moved to my historical repository and may continue to develop.
> So this version is still in development and research phase.

## Modules:

### 1. Flask Blockchain

This module creates a blockchain using Flask, allowing you to interact with it via HTTP requests. Key features include:

- **Creating a new block**: The `/mine` method runs the proof-of-work algorithm and creates a new block.
- **Creating a new transaction**: The `/transactions/new` method allows you to add new transactions to the blockchain.
- **Getting the full chain of blocks**: The `/chain` method returns the current chain of blocks and its length.
- **Registering new nodes**: The `/nodes/register` method allows you to add new nodes to the network.
- **Consensus algorithm**: The `/nodes/resolve` method checks and resolves conflicts in the chain of blocks.

### 2. Simple Blockchain Implementation

This module implements the basic structure of a blockchain with the `Block` and `Blockchain` classes. 
The main functions include:

- **Creating a genesis block**: The `create_genesis_block` method creates the first block in the chain.
- **Adding a new block**: The `add_block` method adds a new block to the chain, setting the correct hash of the previous block.
